Today, I would like to share with you an application of artificial intelligence technology in the field of art - AI painting. AI painting provides artists with a new way of creating, and also makes people more familiar with and interested in artificial intelligence technology.
In fact, AI painting is not a new term that has only emerged in recent years. As early as the last century, artist Harold Cohen had already attempted to collaborate with the computer program "AARON" for painting creation. The difference from current AI painting is that AARON uses Robotic arm to paint on the canvas instead of digital drawing. With the continuous development of technology, AI painting has gradually entered the field of digital drawing.
From the search index provided by Google, "AI painting" has become a hot search term from 2004 to 2007; After 2008, the search popularity began to decline and entered a plateau; Until 2022, AI painting once again became a hot topic of public attention. In the Google Index, its astonishing upward curve can be seen, which means that it is spreading from academia to the public at an unprecedented speed. It can be said that 2022 is the first year of AI generating art.
Nowadays, many artists and companies are researching and developing AI painting technologies, such as DeepDream, GAN, etc. These technologies can imitate the painting style of artists and even create new works of art. The development prospects of AI painting are very broad, and it will play an increasingly important role in the future art field.
