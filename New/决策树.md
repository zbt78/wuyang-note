## Decision

**Decision 1**: How to choose what feature to split on at each node?
- Maximize purity(or minimize impurity)

**Decision 2**: When do you stop splitting?
- When a node is 100% one class
- When splitting a node will result in the tree exceeding a maximum depth
- When improvemennts  in purity score are below a threshold
- When number of examples in a node is below a threshold

## Entropy

Entropy as a measure of impurity
![[Pasted image 20221021170333.png]]
H(p1) = -p1log2(p1) - (1 - p1)log2(1 - p1)

## Information Gain

Information gain = H(p1^root) - (w^left\*H(p1^left) + w^right\*H(p1^right))
